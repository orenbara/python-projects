### Unsuperviced Modules , kmeans , Silhouttes
# I am testing the results of kmeans with the Iris dataset, I found out:
* kmeans implementation i was using will not lable the results in the native order (1,2,3...).
* kmeans results might change between runs - it randomly generates centriods.
* In this lab I noticed that small amount of cluster provide better results (using Silhouttes for testing)
