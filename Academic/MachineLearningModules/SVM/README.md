### SVM with 3 different Kernel Functions:
## I was testing the SVM machine learning module with the Iris data-set.
# The results of this lab include:
* I found out that with 'SVM regularization parameter' we have less errors with 50% testing set.
* Best Kernel Function here is the Linear function.
